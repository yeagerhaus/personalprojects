This is a variable slider I built using HTML/CSS/JavaScript for HitSend Inc.!  HitSend's website was built using WordPress and Elementor, both of which I am familiar with.  The slider and its components are placed in HTML blocks in Elementor's editor, and the Javascript is placed in the footer of the Pricing page so that it runs the slider and its outputs on the page.  If you'd like to see it in action, go to "http://18.222.81.65/pricing/"!
