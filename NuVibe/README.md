If you're wondering where the rest of the work I've done is for NuVibe Juice & Java, go check out the website "https://www.nuvibecoffee.com/"!  

This is the website I currently manage for NuVibe, and was built and managed by Squarespace's service.  Most of the site was built and is maintained using Squarespace's templates and blocks, but the nutrition page was built/styled by me using HTML/CSS.  It was easier to create an HTML table view for the site to use rather than build a table using Squarespace's blocks.
