This is a program I created while I worked for Sandhills Publishing Company as an intern.  I was unable to use it at work because I was not allowed to install Python on my work computer, so this is simply a proof of concept.

The purpose of this program is to perform SSL conversions, something I did a lot of during my internship.  An SSL conversion is when you change your site/sitelinks to use the secure "HTTPS" certificate instead of "HTTP".

To try this program for yourself, make sure all of the links in "index.html" are set to http, and run "sslconvert.py"! (I tested and successfully ran this program using Microsoft's Visual Studio Code)
